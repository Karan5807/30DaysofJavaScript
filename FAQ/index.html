                <p>The backend is the server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.</p>

                <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.
                    <br>
                    Full-stack developers design and create websites and applications for various platforms. A full-stack developerâ€™s job description might include the following:
                        <ul>>> Develop and maintain web services and interfaces</ul>
                        <ul>>> Contribute to front-end and back-end development processes</ul>
                        <ul>>> Build new product features or APIs</ul>
